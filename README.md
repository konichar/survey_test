# Front-end Assignment

Hi there, thanks for taking the time to show us your skills!

By stepping up to this challenge, you give us a chance to see if and how you would fit in with the team technically.

We leave a lot of things in this challenge up to you and that is by design; if it's not specifically mentioned, feel free to pick and choose and inform us about those choices.

## The challenge

Create a web application that meets the following criteria and conforms to the [design specs](https://www.figma.com/file/LcKSjMQAOOnJWdvjQd2QQY/Front-End-Assignment?node-id=2%3A2).

It should feature the following:

- Implement this exact design to the detail.
- Fetch this JSON file https://cache.usabilla.com/example/apidemo.json.
- Display the feedback items in a list.
- Use comment and rating filters to filter feedback items.
- Write unit tests.
- Make the application as responsive as possible for mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Do something creative with the extra data provided in the JSON file.

## What do we expect from you

- A JavaScript (ES6) or TypeScript application, using ReactJS as the component library.
- A working Webpack pipeline that lets us compile and test the code.
- A written README.md with instructions on how to run your test environment, as well as an explanation on how/why did you design things the way you did.
- **Bonus**: A `docker-compose.yaml` file that lets us spin up a test environment without needing to compile anything.

## What are we evaluating

You have all the freedom in the world to solve the challenge as you see fit. We'll not judge you on the choice of framework, serialization library, etc but we will be on the lookout for a few things:

- Your approach to problem solving in general, as well as your attention to the guidelines and specifications.
- Clean and expressive React code, with object-oriented design practices; specifically how clean and organized is your code and how flexible/mature your design looks like.
- Clarity in the decisions and tradeoffs you've made, and how deliberate they feel.
- How do you approach testing and the quality of the tests.
- Your approach towards best practices, coding standards and use of versioning.
- What kind of dependencies you bring into the project, and how do you justify their use.

## Time constraints

Implementing the whole project should not take more than a work day. If the time is not enough, feel free to take productivity shortcuts (but please, explain them).

That being said, we understand that sometimes personal constraints can prevent you from giving the adequate focus, so we ask that you keep us updated if you need more time to work on your assignment.

## How to deliver the project

You will be given access to this private repository. **As soon as you start working, you should create a commit** replacing this `README.md` with a new file, containing your name and the date and time you started working.

Once you're finished with the work, you're to **tag the final commit with v1.0.0, and let our recruitment team know**.

## What if I have questions?

You're welcome to ask questions and clarify requirements with us! For that, you can use the **Issues** tab on GitHub to create a new issue. Make sure to tag @reviewers-fe so we get notified! We'll try to respond to your issue within 1 working day!

Good luck! :) We are looking forward to seeing your results!
